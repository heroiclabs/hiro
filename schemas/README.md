schemas
=======

This folder contains a list of schema validator definitions for Satori.

## Usage

Schemas must be loaded in order based on the numbering in their file name prefixes.

Schema naming must follow the file names but without the number prefix: `01-Hiro-Base` must be used to define a schema validator named `Hiro-Base`, for example.
